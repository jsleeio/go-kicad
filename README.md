# go-kicad

## what is this?

This is a Go library for reading and writing S-expression files generated by
Kicad version 8.x and later.

## future

My intended use case involves only Kicad PCB files, but the S-expression parser
here should be usable for any other Kicad files written in that format.

## history

This is a fork of the `go-kicad` library shared by the excellent Martin Atkins.
Thankyou, Martin!

You can find it here: https://github.com/apparentlymart/go-kicad/

As of this writing (March 2024) Martin's not maintaining that repository
anymore, and also that version isn't compatible with Kicad 8 files, so if you
have questions, I'm happy to (try to) help.
